      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-light-left">Kitsune Sakura Cafe aims to be a diverse restaurant in Auckland
        by teaching people about Japanese culture and mannerisms through delicious food, drinks, and polite waiters. 
        Kitsune Sakura Cafe’s values also what makes it so diverse as polite mannerisms are very important in Japanese culture. Kitsune
        Sakura Cafe also provides an atmosphere of relaxation and cuteness mainly for students to have a safe place to study, relax, 
        and socialize with friends. 
        <br><br>
        Our Cafe name originates from the Kitsune fox, a character from traditional Japanese folklore. The 
        Kitsune fox were known as tricksters who were beautiful and violent creatures. The Sakura (Japanese cherry blossom) also
        symbolizes beauty and violence, inspiring the connection between the 2 in our Cafe name. Kitsune Sakura Cafe’s character, Korai, is 
        a student in a Japanese uniform digitally drawn in the cute Japanese chibi art style. Korai is also wearing a kitsune fox mask
        and sakuras in her hair, to symbolize the Cafe name. Korai being a Japanese school girl clearly shows that Kitsune Sakura Cafe is 
        mainly aimed towards students.</p>
