      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-light-left">Omotenashi Café aims to be a diverse restaurant in Auckland
        by teaching people about Japanese culture and mannerisms through delicious food, drinks, and polite waiters. Omotenashi means superb hospitality, 
        and wholeheartedly looking after customers. Hospitality is our main brand value inspiring the Japanese word "Omotenashi" for our Cafe name.
        Omotenashi Café’s values also what makes it so diverse as good hospitality and polite mannerisms are very important in Japanese culture. Omotenashi 
        Café also provides an atmosphere of relaxation and cuteness mainly for students to have a safe place to study, relax, 
        and socialize with friends. 
        <br><br>
        Our Café logo originates from the Kitsune fox, a character from traditional Japanese folklore. The 
        Kitsune fox were known as tricksters who were beautiful and violent creatures. The Sakura (Japanese cherry blossom) also
        symbolizes beauty and violence, inspiring the connection between the 2 in our Café name. Omotenashi Café’s character, Kōrai, is 
        a student in a Japanese uniform digitally drawn in the cute Japanese chibi art style. Kōrai is also wearing a kitsune fox mask
        and sakuras in her hair, to symbolize the Café name. Kōrai being a Japanese school girl clearly shows that Omotenashi Café is 
        mainly aimed towards students.</p>
